OpenClaw — Personal AI Assistant
OpenClaw

EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE!

CI status GitHub release Discord MIT License

OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It answers you on the channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant.

If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it.

Preferred setup: run the onboarding wizard (openclaw onboard). It walks through gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the recommended path and works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly recommended). Works with npm, pnpm, or bun. New install? Start here: Getting started

Subscriptions (OAuth):

Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max)
OpenAI (ChatGPT/Codex)
Model note: while any model is supported, I strongly recommend Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.5 for long‑context strength and better prompt‑injection resistance. See Onboarding.

Models (selection + auth)
Models config + CLI: Models
Auth profile rotation (OAuth vs API keys) + fallbacks: Model failover
Install (recommended)
Runtime: Node ≥22.

npm install -g openclaw@latest
# or: pnpm add -g openclaw@latest

openclaw onboard --install-daemon
The wizard installs the Gateway daemon (launchd/systemd user service) so it stays running.

Quick start (TL;DR)
Runtime: Node ≥22.

Full beginner guide (auth, pairing, channels): Getting started

openclaw onboard --install-daemon

openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose

# Send a message
openclaw message send --to +1234567890 --message "Hello from OpenClaw"

# Talk to the assistant (optionally deliver back to any connected channel: WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Google Chat/Signal/iMessage/BlueBubbles/Microsoft Teams/Matrix/Zalo/Zalo Personal/WebChat)
openclaw agent --message "Ship checklist" --thinking high
Upgrading? Updating guide (and run openclaw doctor).

Development channels
stable: tagged releases (vYYYY.M.D or vYYYY.M.D-<patch>), npm dist-tag latest.
beta: prerelease tags (vYYYY.M.D-beta.N), npm dist-tag beta (macOS app may be missing).
dev: moving head of main, npm dist-tag dev (when published).
Switch channels (git + npm): openclaw update --channel stable|beta|dev. Details: Development channels.

From source (development)
Prefer pnpm for builds from source. Bun is optional for running TypeScript directly.

git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw

pnpm install
pnpm ui:build # auto-installs UI deps on first run
pnpm build

pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon

# Dev loop (auto-reload on TS changes)
pnpm gateway:watch
Note: pnpm openclaw ... runs TypeScript directly (via tsx). pnpm build produces dist/ for running via Node / the packaged openclaw binary.

Security defaults (DM access)
OpenClaw connects to real messaging surfaces. Treat inbound DMs as untrusted input.

Full security guide: Security

Default behavior on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Microsoft Teams/Discord/Google Chat/Slack:

DM pairing (dmPolicy="pairing" / channels.discord.dm.policy="pairing" / channels.slack.dm.policy="pairing"): unknown senders receive a short pairing code and the bot does not process their message.
Approve with: openclaw pairing approve <channel> <code> (then the sender is added to a local allowlist store).
Public inbound DMs require an explicit opt-in: set dmPolicy="open" and include "*" in the channel allowlist (allowFrom / channels.discord.dm.allowFrom / channels.slack.dm.allowFrom).
Run openclaw doctor to surface risky/misconfigured DM policies.

Key subsystems
Gateway WebSocket network — single WS control plane for clients, tools, and events (plus ops: Gateway runbook).
Tailscale exposure — Serve/Funnel for the Gateway dashboard + WS (remote access: Remote).
Browser control — openclaw‑managed Chrome/Chromium with CDP control.
Canvas + A2UI — agent‑driven visual workspace with A2UI host: Canvas/A2UI).
Voice Wake + Talk Mode — always‑on speech and continuous conversation.
Nodes — Canvas, camera snap/clip, screen record, location.get, notifications, plus macOS‑only system.run/system.notify.
Tailscale access (Gateway dashboard)
OpenClaw can auto-configure Tailscale Serve (tailnet-only) or Funnel (public) while the Gateway stays bound to loopback. Configure gateway.tailscale.mode:

off: no Tailscale automation (default).
serve: tailnet-only HTTPS via tailscale serve (uses Tailscale identity headers by default).
funnel: public HTTPS via tailscale funnel (requires shared password auth).
Notes:

gateway.bind must stay loopback when Serve/Funnel is enabled (OpenClaw enforces this).
Serve can be forced to require a password by setting gateway.auth.mode: "password" or gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false.
Funnel refuses to start unless gateway.auth.mode: "password" is set.
Optional: gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit to undo Serve/Funnel on shutdown.
Details: Tailscale guide · Web surfaces

Remote Gateway (Linux is great)
It’s perfectly fine to run the Gateway on a small Linux instance. Clients (macOS app, CLI, WebChat) can connect over Tailscale Serve/Funnel or SSH tunnels, and you can still pair device nodes (macOS/iOS/Android) to execute device‑local actions when needed.

Gateway host runs the exec tool and channel connections by default.
Device nodes run device‑local actions (system.run, camera, screen recording, notifications) via node.invoke. In short: exec runs where the Gateway lives; device actions run where the device lives.
Details: Remote access · Nodes · Security

macOS permissions via the Gateway protocol
The macOS app can run in node mode and advertises its capabilities + permission map over the Gateway WebSocket (node.list / node.describe). Clients can then execute local actions via node.invoke:

system.run runs a local command and returns stdout/stderr/exit code; set needsScreenRecording: true to require screen-recording permission (otherwise you’ll get PERMISSION_MISSING).
system.notify posts a user notification and fails if notifications are denied.
canvas.*, camera.*, screen.record, and location.get are also routed via node.invoke and follow TCC permission status.
Elevated bash (host permissions) is separate from macOS TCC:

Use /elevated on|off to toggle per‑session elevated access when enabled + allowlisted.
Gateway persists the per‑session toggle via sessions.patch (WS method) alongside thinkingLevel, verboseLevel, model, sendPolicy, and groupActivation.
Details: Nodes · macOS app · Gateway protocol

Agent to Agent (sessions_* tools)
Use these to coordinate work across sessions without jumping between chat surfaces.
sessions_list — discover active sessions (agents) and their metadata.
sessions_history — fetch transcript logs for a session.
sessions_send — message another session; optional reply‑back ping‑pong + announce step (REPLY_SKIP, ANNOUNCE_SKIP).
Details: Session tools

Skills registry (ClawHub)
ClawHub is a minimal skill registry. With ClawHub enabled, the agent can search for skills automatically and pull in new ones as needed.

ClawHub

Chat commands
Send these in WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Google Chat/Microsoft Teams/WebChat (group commands are owner-only):

/status — compact session status (model + tokens, cost when available)
/new or /reset — reset the session
/compact — compact session context (summary)
/think <level> — off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh (GPT-5.2 + Codex models only)
/verbose on|off
/usage off|tokens|full — per-response usage footer
/restart — restart the gateway (owner-only in groups)
/activation mention|always — group activation toggle (groups only)
Apps (optional)
The Gateway alone delivers a great experience. All apps are optional and add extra features.

If you plan to build/run companion apps, follow the platform runbooks below.

macOS (OpenClaw.app) (optional)
Menu bar control for the Gateway and health.
Voice Wake + push-to-talk overlay.
WebChat + debug tools.
Remote gateway control over SSH.
Note: signed builds required for macOS permissions to stick across rebuilds (see docs/mac/permissions.md).

iOS node (optional)
Pairs as a node via the Bridge.
Voice trigger forwarding + Canvas surface.
Controlled via openclaw nodes ….
Runbook: iOS connect.

Android node (optional)
Pairs via the same Bridge + pairing flow as iOS.
Exposes Canvas, Camera, and Screen capture commands.
Runbook: Android connect.
Agent workspace + skills
Workspace root: ~/.openclaw/workspace (configurable via agents.defaults.workspace).
Injected prompt files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md.
Skills: ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md.
Configuration
Minimal ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json (model + defaults):

{
  agent: {
    model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
  },
}
Full configuration reference (all keys + examples).

Security model (important)
Default: tools run on the host for the main session, so the agent has full access when it’s just you.
Group/channel safety: set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "non-main" to run non‑main sessions (groups/channels) inside per‑session Docker sandboxes; bash then runs in Docker for those sessions.
Sandbox defaults: allowlist bash, process, read, write, edit, sessions_list, sessions_history, sessions_send, sessions_spawn; denylist browser, canvas, nodes, cron, discord, gateway.
Details: Security guide · Docker + sandboxing · Sandbox config

WhatsApp
